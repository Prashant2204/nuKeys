Share and Discover Underground Music 

# UX

This application aims to show underground/undiscovered Music and Artists. Being a music enthusiast I have
created this application and also shared some songs that I have researched so far. Through this application
I would also like to encourage others that if anyone likes a music artist or a song which has not achieved 
much popularity in world yet then please add that music here.
